## About Us

We are a web-based disaster relief coordination platform designed to make donations and relief distribution faster, more transparent, and more effective. Built in response to recurring disaster challenges in the Philippines, our system connects government agencies, NGOs, and donors through a single, centralized platform. By transforming manual, fragmented processes into a data-driven digital system, we help ensure that aid reaches the right people, at the right time, with minimal waste and duplication.
